## Streaming Elements 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
It is about Streaming Composeable Web Components defined out of Modular created Elements. In general this can be seen as the Succesor of React, Astro, Vue, DoneJS, CanJS, Svelte, Angular and other legacy Component and Web Element Implementations.
This is where we wanted to be from the start on we wanted that every Element is a Stream of It self and the user Interactions it Ecapsulates.

# 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
To get envolved is easy post a code snippet of a usefull stream into a issue and call the issue Proposal: and your done.

# 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
This is based on over 30 Years of Browser Rendering Engineering and Load optimization after the creation of applications like gmail and google apps. 
In general if your familar with rxjs or even better most/core you can directly jump into the weeds with googling Readable and Writeable Streams.
But i guess this repos are already the most Complet Implementations that we got today.

# 🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
we break so fast we have no time to eat!

# 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
A lessen that i hopefully will learn some time
